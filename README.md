# jstyle_APA
jstyle sheet, APA6 style for LibreOffice with JabRef
This code works in conjunction with the existing programs JabRef and LibreOffice.

To use, connect JabRef to LibreOffice. When connected, click "Select Style" in the LibreOffice citation menu on the left of the
programme. Then click '+' and add the downloaded .jstyle file from here.

Caveat: this code is not perfect. Though I believe I have done a pretty good job, be sure to check your References list and edit 
any weird things before creating your final document. Everytime you click the 'refresh' button in JabRef, it will change any 
manual changes you make in the References in the LibreOffice document. One way to get around this is to change things
in the JabRef sources repository and/or the .jstyle sheet. Another, perhaps easier way is to quickly go through the references
and edit them before saving the final document as a PDF. Then your manual changes will stay the way they are.
